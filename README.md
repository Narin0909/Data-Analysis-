### Employee ID

### job type (part-time,freelance,contract)
#### In worksheet 1 I showed only employees who are freelancers and highlighted the one whose salaries are above $1000.
#### In worksheet 2 I splitted the employees full names into first name and last name using the text delimited. No Duplicates was found.
